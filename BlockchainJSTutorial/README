so the aim here is to work through the sets of tutorials here - https://lhartikk.github.io/ - which walk one through a simple blockchain implementation
// in js to hope to get a fairly good overall understanding of blockchain technologies and how they work generally, and stuff like that
// because it's currently somewhat ofa mystery to me in the concrete details, although the actual abstract workings are fairly known to me now
