// so the aim of this is just a functoin that takes other functions and "bombards" them 
// with all kind of inputs to form a useful testing program ratherthan anything
// kind of silly to be honest like anything else
// I don't even know to be honest
// like the opint of testing isn't really to confirm the path works, but for edge cases
// where this is difficult
// so I don't even know

// okay, our big functoin, I honestly do not even know how this won't work in js
// like there are probably loads of useful javascript specific things to do, I don't know
